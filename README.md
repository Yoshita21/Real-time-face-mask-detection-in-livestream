---- THE REPORT OF THE PROJECT IS UPLOADED-----

# ABSTRACT

In a context of a virulent disease that can be transmitted via sputtering, wearing a face
mask seems to appear important to both the wearer and other people to limit the propagation
of the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary for people around the
world to wear a mask to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. Research indicates
that wearing a face mask properly would help reduce transmission and save lives.
Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, substantial progress in the fields of image
processing and computer vision has been made in the identification of face masks. Several
algorithms and techniques have been used to construct a variety of face recognition
models.
In this project, I proposed a design of a deep learning model using python, TensorFlow,
Keras,MobileNet and open CV.The main goal is to use the trained AI model with a
dataset consisting of masked and unmasked images to identify whether the person is
wearing a mask or not during a Livestream via webcam.This model can be used for
safety purposes since it is very resource efficient to deploy

# PROBLEM FORMULATION

The year 2020 has thrown mankind a mind-boggling sequence of events, the most lifechanging
of which is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shocked the world since the
year began. COVID-19 has called for stringent steps to be followed in order to prevent
the spread of disease, which has an effect on the health and lives of many people.People
are doing whatever they can to ensure their own and societyâ€™s protection, from the most
basic grooming practises to medical treatments; face masks are one of the personal protective
equipment. When people leave their homes, they wear face masks, and officials
make it a point to ensure that people wear face masks in groups and public areas.

A policy should be built to ensure that citizens obey this basic safety concept. To verify
this, a face mask detector device can be used. Face mask detection refers to determining
whether or not someone is wearing a mask.To detect the presence of a mask on a face,
the first move is to detect the face, which divides the technique into two parts: detecting
faces and detecting masks on those faces. Face detection is one of the applications
of object detection, and it can be used in a variety of settings including defence, biometrics,
and law enforcement.Many detector systems have been developed and are in
use around the world. Much of this research, however, requires improvement; a better,
more accurate detector is needed because the world cannot afford any further increases
in corona cases.
In this project, a face mask detector that can tell the difference between people wearing
masks and people who arent will be created. The proposed system in this study uses
facenet for face detection and a neural network to detect the existence of a face mask.
The algorithm is used to process photographs, videos, and live video streams using the
adam optimizer.
